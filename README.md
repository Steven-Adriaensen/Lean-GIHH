# Lean-GIHH
This project contains the source code of Lean-GIHH, a hyper-heuristic for the HyFlex framework.

Lean-GIHH is a simpler variant of GIHH (aka Adap-HH), winner of the CHeSC 2011 competition.
It was derived in [1] from the original by means of Accidental Complexity Analysis (ACA), 
a technique for reducing algorithmic complexity, without loss of performance.
The implementation of Lean-GIHH provided in the src directory counts 288 lines of code (as determined using the cloc tool) as opposed to the 2324 lines of code in the original implementation (see links).

Feel free to use Lean-GIHH in your own research.
